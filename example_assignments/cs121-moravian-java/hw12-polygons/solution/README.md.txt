### Polygon Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is for you to extend an abstract class.

The given code is the same code we worked with in class. Add another class that extends `Polygon` called `RightTriangle` The description of a `RightTriangle` must be "Right triangle". The constructor for a `RightTriangle` must have 2 parameters: the lengths of the 2 legs of the triangle as doubles. The `getArea()` method must return the area of the triangle.

Currently the `main()` method of `Main` adds a `Square` and a `RegularTriangle` to the list `polygons`. Add at least one `RightTriangle` to the `polygons` list as well. Make sure you are satisfied that the area of the `RightTriangle` is being calculated correctly and that its description is correct.
