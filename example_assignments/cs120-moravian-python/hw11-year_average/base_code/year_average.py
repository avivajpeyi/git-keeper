# Write a program which asks the user to enter a year, and then prints out the
# number of countries that have measles vaccination data for that year, and
# the average vaccination coverage percentage worldwide for that year.
#
# If the user enters a year for which there is no data, your program should
# notify the user that there are no countries with data from that year but not
# try to calculate the average (since division by zero results in an error_message).
#
# Example run with a year that has data:
#
# Enter a year: 1992
# There are 186 countries with data from 1992.
# The 1992 worldwide average is 74.05913978494624.
#
# Example run with a year that has no data:
#
# Enter a year: 1990
# There are 0 countries with data from 1990.
