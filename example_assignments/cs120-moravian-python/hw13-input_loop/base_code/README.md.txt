# CS 120 - Homework 13 - Input Loop

For this assignment you will write a program that fills up a list of numbers
which are entered by the user, and then prints some information about the
list of numbers.

Your program should keep asking the user for more numbers until the user enters
an empty string.

Then print out the following information about the list:
* The smallest number
* The largest number
* The sum of the numbers
* The average of the numbers

Here is an example interaction:

    Enter a number for the list: 10
    Enter a number for the list: 8
    Enter a number for the list: 7
    Enter a number for the list: 9
    Enter a number for the list: 11
    Enter a number for the list:
    The smallest number is 7
    The largest number is 11
    The sum of the numbers is 45
    The average of the numbers is 9.0

Write your program in the file `input_loop.py`

Note that this homework is a modified version of homework 5. You may re-use the
same code to compute the min, max, sum, and average as you did for homework 5.

See the section on the book on sentinel loops for more help.
