# CS 120 - Homework 9 - Lists

For this assignment you will write a program that fills up a list of numbers
which are entered by the user, and then prints some information about the
list of numbers.

First your program should ask the user how many numbers they would like to
enter. Then loop that many times, each time asking for a number and then
appending the new number to a list.

Then print out the following information about the list:
* The smallest number
* The largest number
* The sum of the numbers
* The average of the numbers

Here is an example interaction:

    Enter the number of numbers that will be in the list: 5
    Enter a number for the list: 10
    Enter a number for the list: 8
    Enter a number for the list: 7
    Enter a number for the list: 9
    Enter a number for the list: 11
    The smallest number is 7
    The largest number is 11
    The sum of the numbers is 45
    The average of the numbers is 9.0
