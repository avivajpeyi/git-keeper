# CS 120 - Homework 6 - Strings

For this assignment you will write a program to ask the user for two strings
and then output the following:

* The first string
* The second string
* The first string in all uppercase followed by the second string in all
lowercase
* The second string repeated 3 times
* The first letter of the first string followed by the last letter of the
second string
* The first two letters of the first string followed by the first two letters
of the second string
* The first string with a space after each letter

For example, if the user enters the words 'Good' and 'Day', the output of the
program should look like this:

```
Enter a word: Good
Enter another word: Day
Good
Day
GOODday
DayDayDay
Gy
GoDa
G o o d 
```

Write your program in the file `strings_hw.py`
