# Write a program that prints out the name of each country from measles.txt
# that has never had a vaccination rate of above 90%.
#
# Here is a pseudo-code structure for your program:
#
# initialize an empty dictionary
# for each line in measles.txt:
#     extract the country and percentage from the line
#     if the country is not in the dictionary, add it with a value of 0
#     if the country's vaccination percentage is above 90, increment its value
# for each country in the dictionary:
#     if its value is 0, the country
#
# Refer back to previous assignments to remind yourself how to work with
# measles.txt. See the example code from class and in the book for further help
# using dictionaries.
