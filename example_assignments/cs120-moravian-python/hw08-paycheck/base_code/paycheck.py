# Write a program which asks the user to enter the number of hours an employee
# worked and the employee's hourly pay (use 2 separate input statements).
# Using these values, compute the amount of the paycheck for the employee.  If
# the employee works 40 hours or less, the pay is the product of the hours and
# the hourly pay.  However, if the employee works more than 40 hours, the pay
# is the normal rate for the first 40 hours and "time-and-a-half" for the time
# above 40 hours.  Some Examples:
#
# Hours: 35
# Hourly Rate: 7.5
# Pay: 262.5
#
# Hours: 43
# Hourly Rate: 17.25
# Pay: 767.625
#
# Your program should output the exact value calculated.  You do not need to
# worry about rounding to the nearest penny.
